## Changes are going to be made, feel free to suggest any learning material you think could help make it better.


Here is a little guide to kick-start your AI learning adventure. The steps are organized, so you can just start from the beginning and move forward, though that'll depend on your starting knowledge level.

There is no mandatory order or step you must do, but the field is very big, wide, and deep, so everything you can gather will no doubt help you in some way or another.

# 1 
If you are just starting out, you'll have to learn a few tools before starting with AI.

The first and most common one you can not skip is **Python**

If you are tech-savvy and go well with computers and logic, you can start with a Python course, otherwise, you might be better off starting out with an introduction to computer science (still recommended if you want to learn a solid foundation)

Courses:
- [Harvard: CS50 Introduction to computer science](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science)
- [Harvard: CS50P Python](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science)

# 2
Once you have a better handling of Python and maybe even made a project yourself, you can start aiming towards AI.

CS50 keeps being a nice introduction to the field, the environment created is top level and there's an entire community to interact with. It is very light on the math side though, and that can be a good or a bad thing, in my opinion, a little bit more math makes things easier to grasp.

Coursera has a fantastic course specialization from Stanford University, taught by none other than Andrew Ng. They are not free, but you can apply for financial aid if you need it.
The financial aid is done per course, not for the entire specialization, and I recommend you plan it out cause it takes 15 days to get approved.
A free tip I can give you is to go first to 2.5 and learn the math first before starting with any of the Coursera courses as these dive deeper into the math side than the CS50 one.

Courses:
- [Harvard: CS50AI Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python)

# 2.5
If you're really interested in diving deeper into AI, math becomes a necessity to fully understand what's going on inside the black box.
You can pick one of the courses, though if I were you I would take a glance at all of them, or even try to find other sources.
Even when everyone praises one course or teacher you might find it challenging to understand and go easy with another no one told you about, especially with hard abstract subjects like these.
